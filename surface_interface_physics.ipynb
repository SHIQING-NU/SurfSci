In contrast, a bulkemission band is expected to vary in energetic position with changing photon energy. \n",

    "- In contrast to surface states, bulk states are not affected by a surface treatment. If an emission band of the clean surface vanishes after gas adsorption, its origin is likely to be surface states. But care must be taken in applying this rule, since adsorption might also change the transmission conditions for electrons through the surface (due, e.g., to space charge layers.)."
